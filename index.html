  <h2>AKA The Bru with Three Nipples</h2>
  <p>I want to learn code because it is a valuable skill that many people ignore. I wish I had been more exposed to coding in school growing up. I am not sure how many more coding classes I will be able to take in college because of my major. <br><br> I have wanted to visit Africa for a long time. I can't wait to go on a safari and see animals like lions and giraffes. My grandma is a little bitter because she wanted to be the one to take me here, but I have no sympathy because I have been telling her for more than ten years that I wanted to come.<br><br>The hardest part about being here this summer (other than the fact that I am not making any money) is that I can't watch the NBA Finals and, more importantly, the Stanley Cup Finals. I am a Chicago Blackhawks fan and they made it to the Finals, but the games don't start until 2 or 3 in the morning here.</p>
